# Baseball-Batting-and-Salary-Analysis-In-Python

Project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. Project that analyzed salary and batting trends of MLB Players since 1985.

I will be using the salary and batting data from Sean Lahman's baseball database. http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/

I first looked at how salaries of Major League Baseball players have changed from 1985 to present, in terms of median/mean and variability, and then if there were differences between leagues (American and National).

Then I looked to see if certain batting statistics (HR, Batting Average, RBIs, OBP, etc.) had positive relationships with salary. 

Libaries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

I hope you enjoy reading through my analysis here, and I welcome feedback!
